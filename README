= Radiant Multilingual Pages Extension

Provides multilingual pages for Radiant. A multilingual page has one slug for every language. Use slugs like 'about-us-en', 'about-us-de' or 'about-us', 'ueber-uns' and translate away using <r:translate en="Welcome" de="Willkommen" /> and <r:if_language lang="en"><p>Some endlish text</p></r:if_language> ...

This extension is different from the "Language Redirect" extension. "Language Redirect" expects you to replicate your page tree for every language you use. "Multilingual Pages" allows you to define multiple language versions within one single page. 

Good to know: the multi-lang slugs make it cache-safe.
